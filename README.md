The data was obtained from this website:
https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey-survey-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-england-2014

Data refer to the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorders in the English adult population (16 years of age and older). Data are from the years: 1993, 2000, 2007 and 2014. I chose the second chapter which is about CMD (Common Mental Disorders). And I downloaded from the NHS Digital website the data in an xls file and a pdf file with the processed results. I chose to recreate the 2A-2H plots. The other charts are similar.  

Of the more important information that is used in the charts, CIS-R score  is an indication of the overall severity of symptoms:
• CIS-R score of 12 or more is the threshold applied to indicate that a level of CMD symptoms is present such that primary care recognition is warranted. 
• CIS-R score of 18 or more denotes more severe or pervasive symptoms of a level very likely to warrant intervention such as medication or psychological therapy. 

All the data and files that I used were uploaded to github. In the file 'adult_psychiatric_study_ch2_web.pdf', you can find the publication with the original charts, and in the '(original data) apms-2014-ch-02-tabs.xls' file, the raw data. 

Initially, I tried to work with the original data, but I had a lot of problems. I searched the Internet for a solution, but the information I found suggested that it is best to correct the data in the original file. That is why I created new files to which I copied the data necessary to recreate the selected charts, and introduced the necessary modifications. I tried to do it only to the necessary (minimal) extent. I saved the files with the copied data to csv. You can also find them in github. These are: '2.1.csv', '2.2.csv', '2.2a.csv', '2.3.csv' and '2.3a.csv'.

I wrote the code in Google Colab. You can find it in the file: 'homework_2_21_01_2022_zad.ipynb'.
