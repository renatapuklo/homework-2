The data was obtained from this website:
https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey/adult-psychiatric-morbidity-survey-survey-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-england-2014

Data refer to the prevalence of both treated and untreated psychiatric disorders in the English adult population (16 years of age and older). Data are from the years: 1993, 2000, 2007 and 2014. I chose the second chapter which is about CMD (Common Mental Disorders). And I downloaded from the NHS Digital website the data in an xls file and a pdf file with the processed results. I chose to recreate the 2A-2H plots. 

Of the more important information that is used in the charts, CIS-R score  is an indication of the overall severity of symptoms:
• CIS-R score of 12 or more is the threshold applied to indicate that a level of CMD symptoms is present such that primary care recognition is warranted. 
• CIS-R score of 18 or more denotes more severe or pervasive symptoms of a level very likely to warrant intervention such as medication or psychological therapy.
